## v0.5.0 - 2021-11-18

This release adds support for Python 3.9 and updates dependencies to ensure compatibility with the
rest of the SDV ecosystem, and upgrades to the latests [RDT](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/releases/tag/v0.6.1)
release.

### Issues closed

## v0.4.3 - 2021-07-12

Dependency upgrades to ensure compatibility with the rest of the SDV ecosystem.

## v0.4.2 - 2021-04-27

In this release, the way in which the loss function of the TVAE model was computed has been fixed.
In addition, the default value of the `discriminator_decay` has been changed to a more optimal
value. Also some improvements to the tests were added.

### Issues closed

* `TVAE`: loss function - Issue [#143](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/143) by @fealho and @DingfanChen
* Set `discriminator_decay` to `1e-6` - Pull request [#145](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/pull/145/) by @fealho
* Adds unit tests - Pull requests [#140](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/pull/140) by @fealho

## v0.4.1 - 2021-03-30

This release exposes all the hyperparameters which the user may find useful for both `CTGAN`
and `TVAE`. Also `TVAE` can now be fitted on datasets that are shorter than the batch
size and drops the last batch only if the data size is not divisible by the batch size.

### Issues closed

* `TVAE`: Adapt `batch_size` to data size - Issue [#135](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/135) by @fealho and @csala
* `ValueError` from `validate_discre_columns` with `uniqueCombinationConstraint` - Issue [133](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/133) by @fealho and @MLjungg

## v0.4.0 - 2021-02-24

Maintenance relese to upgrade dependencies to ensure compatibility with the rest
of the SDV libraries.

Also add a validation on the CTGAN `condition_column` and `condition_value` inputs.

### Improvements

* Validate condition_column and condition_value - Issue [#124](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/124) by @fealho

## v0.3.1 - 2021-01-27

### Improvements

* Check discrete_columns valid before fitting - [Issue #35](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/35) by @fealho

## Bugs fixed

* ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence - [Issue #115](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/issues/115) by @fealho

## v0.3.0 - 2020-12-18

In this release we add a new TVAE model which was presented in the original CTGAN paper.
It also exposes more hyperparameters and moves epochs and log_frequency from fit to the constructor.

A new verbose argument has been added to optionally disable unnecessary printing, and a new hyperparameter
called `discriminator_steps` has been added to CTGAN to control the number of optimization steps performed
in the discriminator for each generator epoch.

The code has also been reorganized and cleaned up for better readability and interpretability.

Special thanks to @Baukebrenninkmeijer @fealho @leix28 @csala for the contributions!

## v0.2.2 - 2020-11-13

In this release we introduce several minor improvements to make CTGAN more versatile and
propertly support new types of data, such as categorical NaN values, as well as conditional
sampling and features to save and load models.

Additionally, the dependency ranges and python versions have been updated to support up
to date runtimes.
